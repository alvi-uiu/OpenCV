### **Canny Edge Detection**  
- **What it does:** Detects edges in an image by identifying areas with rapid intensity changes.  
- **When to use:** When you need to find object boundaries, segment objects, or detect edges before contour detection.  
- **Key parameters:** Two threshold values (e.g., `125, 175` in `cv.Canny(img, 125, 175)`) for edge gradient strength.

### **Contours**  
- **What it does:** Finds and represents the shape of objects in an image by detecting continuous curves around them.  
- **When to use:** Object detection, shape analysis, or extracting objects from an image.  
- **Key function:** `cv.findContours()`â€”detects contours from an edge-detected or binary image.

### **Thresholding**  
- **What it does:** Converts an image to binary (black & white) by setting pixels above a threshold to white and below to black.  
- **When to use:** Image segmentation, object separation, or preparing an image for contour detection.  
- **Key function:** `cv.threshold(img, 125, 255, cv.THRESH_BINARY)` (sets pixels >125 to 255 and the rest to 0).
